Welcome to the Integrated Digital Built Environment (IDBE) Geotechnical Engineering standardization effort. For more information on the IDBE, visit the [OGC public information page](http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/idbesc).

This GitHub repository is the workplace for collection of use cases and identification of existing work on the topic. The repository is public to allow the maximum number of stakeholders to participate in this collection effort.

If you are new to GitHub, instructions on its basic use are provided under [Using GitHub](https://github.com/opengeospatial/IDBE-Geotech) on this page.

## Repository Contents

### Use Cases
The [use_cases](https://github.com/opengeospatial/IDBE-Geotech/use_cases) folder contains descriptions of individual use cases, organized as documents. There is also a template document for users to create new use cases.

### Standards Catalog
The [standards_catalog](https://github.com/opengeospatial/IDBE-Geotech/standards_catalog) folder contains contains a catalog of individual standards and specifications, organized as documents. There is also a template document for users to create new standard summaries.

## Using GitHub

<hr/>
⚠️ Note for experienced GitHub users:
No need to read the rest of this document. We would prefer that you work in branches in the main repository and make pull requests for your changes, but direct push to the master branch is acceptable if you are a member of the project team. You are also free to fork the repository and make pull requests from your fork.
<hr/>

If you are not familiar with using GitHub, then read on. You probably should use the simplest tools available. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to allow you to manage your work and contributions to the IDBE-Geotech project through a simple interface.

The workflow is actually very easy. You will work on local files on your computer and can edit and manage those files just like any others. The only extra step is that you need to periodically synchronize your files with the online GitHub repository and have the repository managers assess and integrate your new work.

### Get access to the GitHub repository
This repository is open to the public and anyone can create new [Issues](https://github.com/opengeospatial/IDBE-Geotech/issues) to make suggestions for the work. If you are already a member of the IDBE group or would like to more actively contribute to this effort, we will be happy to add you to the project team. First, make sure that you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join). Then, send your contact information, your GitHub ID, and a brief description of how you want to contribute to [standards@opengeospatial.org](mailto:standards@opengeospatial.org).

### Download a local copy of the GitHub repository


### File management
If you want to make a new use case or register a new standard, first make a copy of the template document in your file system. Then name the copy something short and descriptive and edit. When you synchronize with the central repository, your new file will be uploaded.

### File editing
All of the files in the project are formatted as AsciiDoc.
